# Anomaly-Detection
Design, Implementation and Evaluation of an Outlier Detection Techniques for a Spatial Dataset
The goal of this task is to design and implement a bivariate, spatial outlier detection techniques of your own preference. I have applied the different statistical techniques to the 2-dimensional dataset called Complex8_RN15 , is the variation of the Complex8 dataset with 15% Gaussian noise added to the original Complex8 dataset which can be found at:  http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~ceick/DM/Complex8.csv; however, the original dataset should only be used for visualization purposes. Finally,  I have evaluated the technique and. My outlier detection technique takes the dataset and creates a copy of the dataset that contains an additional column/attribute called ols (“outlier score”) which contains numbers that indicates how much your outlier detection method believes that the particular object is an outlier—the smaller the value of the ols attribute the less likely the object is believed to be an outlier.
